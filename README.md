# About
omnipy is a PDM (personal diabetes manager) emulator for the OmniPod insulin pump and it can be used to command the pump to perform various functions over a network. It is designed to be used over sub-optimal networking conditions (such as the internet) therefore uses the MQTT protocol to listen for commands and forward responses.

# Important Background Information
This used to be a pet project, where I investigated the radio communication between the OmniPod and the PDM. Whilst still studying the OmniPod, I have decided that there was enough information available to let it execute basic commands which would make it usable in an artifical pancreas system. I've put together a prototype and integrated it into AndroidAPS for my own use, which became what it is today.

As a father of a child with Type I diabetes, I desperately needed something until there was a "proper" solution, so this piece of software became indispensible, albeit its design issues and lack of user-friendliness.

You are welcome to test it and report issues, but be aware you are doing this on your **own risk** and so far it has been tested by **only two people**.

# Requirements
* RileyLink with firmware v2
* A linux computer with bluetooth (e.g. Raspberry Pi)
* An android phone capable of running AndroidAPS
